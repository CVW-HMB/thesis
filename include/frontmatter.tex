\begin{abstract}
A search is performed in final states with Z$\rightarrow\ell\ell$, jets, and missing transverse momentum using data collected with the
CMS detector at the CERN LHC in 2015 corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3~\fbinv of pp collisions at $\sqrt{s}=13$\TeV.
Signal regions are defined to maximize sensitivity to new physics including one to search where ATLAS reported a 3.0~$\sigma$ excess at 8~TeV.
The observations in all regions are consistent with the predicted standard model backgrounds,
and the results are interpreted in the context of simplified models of supersymmetry.
