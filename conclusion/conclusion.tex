A search for new physics beyond the standard model has been performed using data collected by the CMS detector in 2015.
No significant excess beyond the standard model background predictions was observed,
and upper limits were set on the cross section in the context of a SUSY model where two gluinos are pair produced,
and subsequently decay to quarks and a neutralino.
The neutralino then decays to a Z boson, and a gravitino in this model, where the gravitino is expected to be massless.
Models where the gluino has a mass range of 1050 to 1300 GeV are excluded by these results.
